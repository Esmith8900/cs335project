## About
You control no ordinary piece of cosmic debris making his way through the Sleipnir galaxy. You have dreams and ambitions of becoming the biggest piece of debris in the galaxy. The goal is simple, become the biggest piece of cosmic debris in the galaxy. In order to achieve this you have to navigate around the screen and absorb other cosmic debris, which causes you to grow in size. You can absorb objects as well as other players by colliding with them, given you are bigger than them. However, colliding with something bigger than you will mean game over.
